# Talking to 25% of the Web: an in-depth report and analysis on the WordPress REST API

Welcome to the online repository for *[Talking to 25% of the Web: an in-depth report and analysis on the WordPress REST API](http://hmn.md)*. Here you can find markdown versions of the text, the PDF, source files for diagrams, and translations.

## Translations
We encourage you to translate the REST API white paper and make it available in your own language. Send us a pull request and we'll add it to the main repo.

To translate the white paper, please create a sub-directory of the project under Working Translations, giving it the correct ISO639 code (for example, pt for Portuguese), and submit a pull request. Once the translation has reached a release / first full translation, we'll move it to its own subdirectory at the top level, and subsequent updates will happen in that location.

You can use the [ai files in the resources](resources/) folder to create translations of any diagrams (nb: fonts are proprietary and not included).

If you wish to create a PDF version please [contact us for InDesign files](mailto:hello@hmn.md).

Add a list of translators to your locale's version of the [readme](https://github.com/humanmade/rest-api-white-paper/blob/master/en/readme.md).
