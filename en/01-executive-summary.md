# Executive Summary

*WordPress is an open-source content management system which is used to power millions of websites and blogs, and an increasing number of web applications.*

[It currently powers more than 25% of the top 10 million websites on the Internet](http://w3techs.com/technologies/history_overview/content_management/all/y). WordPress’ usability, extensibility, and mature development community make it a popular choice for web projects of all sizes.

WordPress, like many other CMSes, is monolithic. It provides everything you need to run a website, and can be extended further with third-party plugins and themes. But on today’s web, we are moving beyond the monolithic CMS. WordPress, along with others, is leading the charge to a future where the CMS acts as a central hub, consuming and aggregating content and data from other tools and services and in-turn exposing its own content and data via APIs.

The WordPress REST API is a huge step towards this future. Exposing WordPress content and data as JSON via a standardised RESTful API unlocks your data and will enable an explosion in the number and complexity of integrations.

By embracing the WordPress REST API, you can more easily:
- separate your frontend delivery from the CMS
- power multiple frontends from the same content (think a website, app, Apple News, etc.)
- and use WordPress as part of complex multi-service workflows (like pushing content to a separate service for translation before pulling those translations back into WordPress).

The potential implications for your business are far-reaching, particularly for large custom builds and applications. WordPress provides content management and content capture, while making the data available to other frontend technologies. This permits engineering teams to work independently on discrete parts of a larger project, and allows for more stable third-party integrations.

With the REST API, WordPress stops being a web development tool used in isolation. It is one module that is available in a web developer’s toolkit; a building block to be used in many kinds of applications.

The potential implications for your business are far-reaching, particularly for large custom builds and applications.
